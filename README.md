 - **！If need more function please download 34736384's unlocker,This repo only unlock fps.** [34736384's unlocker](https://github.com/34736384/genshin-fps-unlock)

 - This tool helps you to unlock the 60 fps limit in the game
 - This is an external program which uses **WriteProcessMemory** to write the desired fps to the game
 - Handle protection bypass is already included
 - Does not require a driver for R/W access
 - Supports OS and CN version
 - Should work for future updates
 - If the source needs to be updated, I'll try to do it as soon as possible
 - You can download the compiled binary over at [Release](https://github.com/winTEuser/genshin-StarRail-fps-unlock/releases) if you don't want to compile it yourself

 ## Compiling
 - Use Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition to compile

 ## Usage
 - Run the exe and click the game you want to open. 
 - If it is your first time running, unlocker will wait game start then antomatically to set game path . 
 - Place the compiled exe anywhere you want (except for the game folder)
 - Make sure your game is closed—the unlocker will automatically start the game for you
 - Run the exe as administrator, and leave the exe running
 >It requires adminstrator because the game needs to be started by the unlocker and the game requires such permission

### Default Hotkey
- **END**                                 ON/OFF
- **Right Ctrl + Up key**        (+20)
- **Right Ctrl + Right key**    (+2)
- **Right Ctrl + Down key**   (-20)
- **Right Ctrl + Left Key**       (-2)

## HotPatch
 - Make the unlock continue to take effect 
 - Change game fps set: 
 - 30 -> 60(open ANNCMT won't cause stalling)
 - 45 -> your fps target
 - 60 -> no limit
 - StarRail change **all fps** set to your fps target

 ## Notes
 - HoYoverse (miHoYo) is well aware of this tool, and you will not get banned for using **ONLY** fps unlock.
 - If you are using other third-party plugins, you are doing it at your own risk.
 - Any artifacts from unlocking fps (e.g. stuttering) is **NOT** a bug of the unlocker
